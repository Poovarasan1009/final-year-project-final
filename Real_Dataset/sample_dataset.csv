"What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.","Machine learning is when computers learn from data without being programmed.",85
"Explain photosynthesis","Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water, producing oxygen as a byproduct. This process occurs in chloroplasts and involves light-dependent and light-independent reactions.","Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide.",78
"What are the advantages of renewable energy?","Renewable energy sources offer several advantages: reduced greenhouse gas emissions, sustainability, lower long-term costs, energy independence, job creation, and minimal environmental impact compared to fossil fuels.","Renewable energy is good because it doesn't pollute and won't run out.",72
"Define artificial intelligence","Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.","AI is making computers smart like humans to solve problems.",80
"Explain Newton's first law of motion","Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This is also called the law of inertia.","If something is moving, it keeps moving unless something stops it.",75
"What is a database index?","A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. It works like a book index, allowing the database to find rows without scanning the entire table.","It helps find things faster in a database.",85
"Describe the water cycle","The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and collection.","Water evaporates, makes clouds, and then rains back down.",80
"What is the function of the mitochondria?","The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for generating most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.","It makes energy for the cell.",90
"Explain global warming","Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.","The earth is getting hotter because of pollution.",70
"Difference between RAM and ROM","RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory used for temporary storage while the computer is running. ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile memory that stores permanent instructions for booting the computer.","RAM forgets everything when you turn off the computer, but ROM remembers.",88
"What is object-oriented programming?","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).","It uses classes and objects to write code.",82
